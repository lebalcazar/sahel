# About repository

The /sahel repository is a GNU-GPL project. The goal of this repository is to provide scripts and data for reproducible paper research Development and assessment of seasonal rainfall forecasting models for the Bani and the Senegal basins by identifying the best predictive teleconnection.

data/gpkg: is a spatial data vector file. The location of weather stations are derived from the Bâ et al. (2018) databases. Rivers and boundaries are data from https://www.hydrosheds.org/products, and data for SST, RHUM and MSLP regions that comes from PCA and cluster analysis. The watersheds are obtained from a 90-meter of DEM https://srtm.csi.cgiar.org/.
